Overview of the Project 
The project involves the analysis of coffee sales data collected from one fictional coffee shop with three store locations in New York City, in January-June 2023. The dataset is open to the community and provided by Maven Analytics. The primary goal of this project is to examine purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences associated with coffee products and other products offered by the coffee shop. By analyzing this dataset, actionable insights can be revealed that will help to inform leadership to make appropriate business decisions and improve customer satisfaction.
The dataset for this analysis was obtained from Maven Analytics. 

Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:
•	Analyze Sales Data: Explore the dataset to understand how different types of coffee and other offerings of the coffee shop are sold, the impact of store location, prices, and sales distribution over time.
•	Develop Visualizations: Create clear and informative visualizations to present the findings, making them accessible to stakeholders.
•	Identify Customer Preferences: Determine the coffee products and other offerings that are most favored by customers and identify patterns in buying behavior.

About the Dataset
This dataset contains detailed records of coffee sales of the coffee shop, which has 3 locations in New York. All the data are stored in an Excel file. The dataset includes information on the type and category of the products sold, the transaction date, time and quantity, and the store location. The data is comprehensive, offering a valuable resource for examining coffee sales patterns.
Key Features of the Dataset
•	Product Information: Details about different types of coffee, drinks, and pastries available are included in the dataset, together with the store locations. 
•	Transaction Data: Each record contains information on the transaction, its date, time, and quantity. 
•	Sales Data: Revenue generated from each sale is revealed by using basic Excel formulas, which allows to analyze a financial performance of the coffee shop.

Tools and Technologies
•	Excel: data cleaning and transformation (including filtering and sorting data, data validation, Text functions, Date&Time functions), Conditional Formatting, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts. 

Project Path
1. Data Collection, Cleaning and Transformation
•	The dataset is downloaded from the data source.
•	The dataset is verified for missing values; consistency in data formatting is secured.
•	A new column, such as Revenue, using a basic Excel formula, has been created, to analyze the financial performance of the coffee shop. 
•	Time fields as Month Number, Month Name, Day of Week Number, Day of Week Name, and Hour, using Date&Time functions, have been added to the dataset to prepare the data for analysis. 
2. Sales Analysis using Pivot Tables
•	A set of Pivot Tables (such as Revenue by Month, Revenue by Product Type, Number of Transactions by Day of Week, Number of Transactions by Working Hours, Number of Transactions by Product Category, and Top 15 of Transactions) has been created to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
•	Conditional Formatting has been used to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and sales performance.
3. Visualization Development
•	A dynamic dashboard has been built using Pivot Charts to deliver the analysis findings. 
•	Line Chart: Shows the revenue the coffee shop earned by month to monitor changes in sales and revenue over time and detect seasonal variations. 
•	Column Charts: Display the number of transactions across days of the week and hours of the day to highlight sales patterns across different days of the week and to identify peak selling hours. 
•	Bar Charts: Illustrate the number of transactions by category of the product, the revenue earned from selling each type of the product, and Top-15 types of product by number of transactions.
•	Slicer: A slicer has been added to the visualization to make it dynamic and to show the differences in revenue and transaction data within different store locations. 
4. Final Report and Outcomes 
•	The analysis results, visualizations, and insights are composed into a final report.
•	Outcomes:
	From the visualization we can observe that the highest revenue is in May and June, simultaneously the revenue in February is the lowest within all months. 
	From the bar chart, we can see that Brewed Chai Tea and Gourmet Brewed Coffee are the most favored products by customers. On the other side, the sales of Barista Espresso and Brewed Chai Tea increased the revenue remarkably. Сorrespondingly, the most popular product categories are Coffee and Tea. 
	From the column charts, we can conclude that the peak purchasing hours are 7-10 am, presumably people prefer to consume coffee and pastries during morning hours and/or before work, and much more often they need a dose of caffeine or something sweet on Thursdays and Fridays. 
	Also, it is interesting that people who visit the coffee shop in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood, like to drink coffee on Sundays, and, on the other hand, people from Lower Manhattan choose to grab a cup of coffee on Mondays. 

Conclusion
This project transforms raw data from a coffee shop sales into valuable business insights. It uses different Excel techniques to prepare data before analysis, make a visual interpretation of it, and provide insights for making data-driven decisions that can optimize operations and increase profitability.
