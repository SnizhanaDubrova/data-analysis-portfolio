Data analysis portfolio by Snizhana Dubrova

Hello!

I'm a detail-oriented and results-driven professional with a strong foundation in administrative support and a growing passion for business and data analysis. I'm proficient in Excel (Advanced Functions, Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts), SQL, MySQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI. 
I'm actively seeking a Junior Analyst position where I can apply my analytical skills and attention to detail to support data-driven decision-making. I'm eager to contribute to a dynamic environment, leveraging my organizational skills, critical thinking, and continuous learning to drive team success.

This portfolio showcases my personal projects, allowing me to explore new technologies, demonstrate my passion for analysis, and continually enhance my skillset.

Feel free to connect with me if you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss potential opportunities.
